# MyReads Project

Project for tracking book shelf status and fetch new books from search directory

## TL;DR

To get started right away:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`

## File Structure

```bash
├── CONTRIBUTING.md
├── README.md - This file.
├── SEARCH_TERMS.md # The whitelisted short collection of available search terms to use with the app.
├── package.json # npm package manager file.

    ├── App.css # Styles for app.
    ├── App.js # This is the root of the app.
    ├── App.test.js # Used for testing.
    ├── BooksAPI.js # A JavaScript API for the provided backend.

    │   └── arrow-drop-down.svg
    ├── index.css # Global styles.
    └── index.js # It is used for DOM rendering only.
```

## Important

The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend.

## Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). You can find more information on how to perform common tasks [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).
